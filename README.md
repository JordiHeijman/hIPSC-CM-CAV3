# hIPSC-CM-CAV3
Myokit code for simulations with the WT and CAV3 KO versions of the Kernik hIPSC cardiomyocyte model

**Functional Stabilization of the Lactate-Proton Shuttle McT1 Requires Isoform-specific Caveolin Interactions in Cardiomyocyctes**

This GitHub page contains the source codes in Myokit file format (.mmt) for:

1. INaL optimization (based on voltage clamp experiments data)
2. 0-dimensional simulation of EAD in Kernik hiPSC-CM model
3. 2-dimensional simulation of hiPSC model with heterogenous repolarization region
4. Example video of 2-dimensional simulation, resulting in figure-8 of reentry
